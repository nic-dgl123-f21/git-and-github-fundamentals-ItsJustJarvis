# Learning Outcomes

While I have already grown quite comfortable using GitHub this brief overview was a welcomed refresher course.

Reading this content reaffirmed my understanding of the process used to create, maintain and update repositories using:

    - Git
    - GitHub
    - GitHub Desktop

I hope to explore more of these functionalities in practise throughout the rest of my studies. We have barely scratched the surface of GitHub thus far.

I loved the collaborative nature of Pull Requests when we used them in our previous app development courses and hope to use these more. I feel that being able to examine one anothers code and add comments and suggestions directly to the project would be a valuable addition to our education and help prepare us for working in the industry.

However, I do understand the limitations we face with some students having no prior experience in this area.

Either way, I look forward to what comes next.
